# Objective
The aim of this project is to use python (specifically Pandas and Matplotlib modules) to perform data analysis and visualisation on the Fuel economy dataset.
The project demostrates various data cleaning processes, after which we infer interesting information regarding how the fuel economy and car performance has changed over the years (namely comparing 2008 and 2018) dataset. The analysis is supported by data vizualisation. All the data handling techniques used and the reason for it are giving in the notebook (.ipynb file)
